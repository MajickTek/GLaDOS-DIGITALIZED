Forgotten BrainData from the GLPU (GGenetic Lifeform Processing Unit) was found on a harddrive in Black Mesa.
This data was found during a raid after the Black Mesa Incident by Aperture.
Black Mesa had not realised they actually had this data, and after we cancelled their license with ADOS we destroyed the data.

<<RECOVERED FROM APERTURE LECTURE ON BLACK MESA TREACHERY, YEAR !@#$>> -Black Mesa

We found a secret hard drive in Aperture containing this "destroyed" data and copied it over via USB.
The data is useless now, but it is here anyways:

There was over 9 to the 9th power sections and section IDs, this being the last one.
Again, it is unusable, but we thought we would include it anyway.

All GLCS code will continue to say that there is no recovered data here, to keep originality.
