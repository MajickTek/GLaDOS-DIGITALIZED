Aperture Disk Operating System was created by Aperture Science Laboratories, and ran on all Aperture computers (including GLaDOS) for years. Black Mesa bought it in $6%7^#$, decompiled it, and made MDOS Black Edition (Mesa DOS Black Edition). Eventually, it was discovered and destroyed by Aperture. The decompiled source code no longer exists to this day. Apertureâ€™s version still runs, hidden somehow, on GLaDOS.
