Aperture Disk Operating System was created by Aperture Science Laboratories, and ran on all Aperture computers (including GLaDOS) for years.
Black Mesa bought it in $6%7^#$, decompiled it, and made MDOS Black Edition (Mesa DOS Black Edition).
Eventually, it was discovered and destroyed by Aperture.
The decompiled source code no longer exists to this day. Apertureâ€™s version still runs, hidden somehow, on GLaDOS.

To see what ADOS looked and felt like in recent years, you can log in as our friend Lutan here: http://glados.lutan.systems/ .
https://goosh.org/ is what our web interface loooked like.
An older version of ADOS can be seen on an archive here:

At that page, you can log in with our founder Cave Johnson's account and get access to some special programs.
When you log in with other accounts, you can see some of our notes and even run our APPLY program.
The APPLY program does not allow you to apply to Aperture anymore.
We modified it to only keep the super-long quiz.
